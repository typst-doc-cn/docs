# Formatting
So far, you have written a report with some text, a few equations and images.
However, it still looks very plain. Your teaching assistant does not yet know
that you are using a new typesetting system, and you want your report to fit in
with the other student's submissions. In this chapter, we will see how to format
your report using Typst's styling system."""

[[main]]
en = """## Set rules
As we have seen in the previous chapter, Typst has functions that _insert_
content (e.g. the [`image`] function) and others that _manipulate_ content that
they received as arguments (e.g. the [`align`] function). The first impulse you
might have when you want, for example, to justify the report, could be to look
for a function that does that and wrap the complete document in it."""

  In the case of glaciers, fluid
  dynamics principles can be used
  to understand how the movement
  and behaviour of the ice is
  influenced by factors such as
  temperature, pressure, and the
  presence of other fluids (such as
  water).
]
```"""

[[main]]
en = """Wait, shouldn't all arguments of a function be specified within parentheses? Why
is there a second set of square brackets with content _after_ the parentheses?
The answer is that, as passing content to a function is such a common thing to
do in Typst, there is special syntax for it: Instead of putting the content
inside of the argument list, you can write it in square brackets directly after
the normal arguments, saving on punctuation."""

[[main]]
en = """As seen above, that works. The [`par`] function justifies all paragraphs within
it. However, wrapping the document in countless functions and applying styles
selectively and in-situ can quickly become cumbersome."""

style properties to all occurrences of some kind of content. You write a set

If you followed along and tried a few things in the app, you might have noticed

That's the autocomplete panel. It can be very useful while you are writing your

the desired completion with the arrow keys. The panel can be dismissed by
hitting the Escape key and opened again by typing `#` or hitting
