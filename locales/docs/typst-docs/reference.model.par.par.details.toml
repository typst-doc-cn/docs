part of a paragraph. However, it is still important for various reasons:"""

[[main]]

  proper paragraphs, not any text. Similarly, `par` show rules of course
  only trigger on paragraphs."""

[[main]]
en = """- A proper distinction between paragraphs and other text helps people who
  rely on assistive technologies (such as screen readers) navigate and

over whether Typst creates paragraphs. By wrapping text in a [`block`]
instead of just adding paragraph breaks around it, you can force the absence
of a paragraph. Conversely, by adding a [`parbreak`] after some content in a
container, you can force it to become a paragraph even if it's just one
word. This is, for example, what [non-`tight`]($list.tight) lists do to
force their items to become paragraphs."""
