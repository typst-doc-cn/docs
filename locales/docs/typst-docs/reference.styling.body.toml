# Styling
Typst includes a flexible styling system that automatically applies styling of
your choice to your document. With _set rules,_ you can configure basic
properties of elements. This way, you create most common styles. However, there
might not be a built-in property for everything you wish to do. For this reason,
Typst further supports _show rules_ that can completely redefine the appearance
of elements."""

[[main]]
en = """## Set rules
With set rules, you can customize the appearance of elements. They are written
as a [function call]($function) to an [element
function]($function/#element-functions) preceded by the `{set}` keyword (or
`[#set]` in markup). Only optional parameters of that function can be provided
to the set rule. Refer to each function's documentation to see which parameters
are optional. In the example below, we use two set rules to change the
[font family]($text.font) and [heading numbering]($heading.numbering)."""

#set heading(numbering: \\"I.\\")
#set text(
  font: \\"New Computer Modern\\"

With set rules, you can style
your document.

block, you can thus restrict the effect of a rule to a particular segment of
your document. Below, we use a content block to scope the list styling to one
particular list."""

With show rules, you can deeply customize the look of a type of element. The
most basic form of show rule is a _show-set rule._ Such a rule is written as the
`{show}` keyword followed by a [selector], a colon and then a set rule. The most
basic form of selector is an [element function]($function/#element-functions).
This lets the set rule only apply to the selected element. In the example below,
headings become dark blue while all other text stays black."""

[[main]]
en = """With show-set rules you can mix and match properties from different functions to
achieve many different effects. But they still limit you to what is predefined
in Typst. For maximum flexibility, you can instead write a show rule that
defines how to format an element from scratch. To write such a show rule,
replace the set rule after the colon with an arbitrary [function]. This function
receives the element in question and can return arbitrary content. The available
[fields]($scripting/#fields) on the element passed to the function again match
the parameters of the respective element function. Below, we define a show rule
that formats headings for a fantasy encyclopedia."""
