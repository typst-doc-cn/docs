You can specify a customized formatting using the
[`display`]($datetime.display) method. The format of a datetime is
specified by providing _components_ with a specified number of _modifiers_.
A component represents a certain part of the datetime that you want to
display, and with the help of modifiers you can define how you want to
display that component. In order to display a component, you wrap the name
of the component in square brackets (e.g. `[[year]]` will display the year).
In order to add modifiers, you add a space after the component name followed
by the name of the modifier, a colon and the value of the modifier (e.g.
`[[month repr:short]]` will display the short representation of the month)."""

en = """The possible combination of components and their respective modifiers is as
follows:"""

[[main]]
en = """- `year`: Displays the year of the datetime.
  - `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the
    year is padded.
  - `repr` Can be either `full` in which case the full year is displayed or
    `last_two` in which case only the last two digits are displayed.
  - `sign`: Can be either `automatic` or `mandatory`. Specifies when the
    sign should be displayed.
- `month`: Displays the month of the datetime.
  - `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the
    month is padded.
  - `repr`: Can be either `numerical`, `long` or `short`. Specifies if the
    month should be displayed as a number or a word. Unfortunately, when
    choosing the word representation, it can currently only display the
    English version. In the future, it is planned to support localization.
- `day`: Displays the day of the datetime.
  - `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the
    day is padded.
- `week_number`: Displays the week number of the datetime.
  - `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the
    week number is padded.
  - `repr`: Can be either `ISO`, `sunday` or `monday`. In the case of `ISO`,
     week numbers are between 1 and 53, while the other ones are between 0
     and 53.
- `weekday`: Displays the weekday of the date.
  - `repr` Can be either `long`, `short`, `sunday` or `monday`. In the case
    of `long` and `short`, the corresponding English name will be displayed
    (same as for the month, other languages are currently not supported). In
    the case of `sunday` and `monday`, the numerical value will be displayed
    (assuming Sunday and Monday as the first day of the week, respectively).
  - `one_indexed`: Can be either `true` or `false`. Defines whether the
    numerical representation of the week starts with 0 or 1.
- `hour`: Displays the hour of the date.
  - `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the
    hour is padded.
  - `repr`: Can be either `24` or `12`. Changes whether the hour is
    displayed in the 24-hour or 12-hour format.
- `period`: The AM/PM part of the hour
  - `case`: Can be `lower` to display it in lower case and `upper` to
    display it in upper case.
- `minute`: Displays the minute of the date.
  - `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the
    minute is padded.
- `second`: Displays the second of the date.
  - `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the
    second is padded."""

en = """Keep in mind that not always all components can be used. For example, if you
create a new datetime with `{datetime(year: 2023, month: 10, day: 13)}`, it
will be stored as a plain date internally, meaning that you cannot use
components such as `hour` or `minute`, which would only work on datetimes
that have a specified time."""
