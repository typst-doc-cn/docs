store integers, integers cannot be smaller than `{-9223372036854775808}` or
larger than `{9223372036854775807}`. Integer literals are always positive,
so a negative integer such as `{-1}` is semantically the negation `-` of the
positive literal `1`. A positive integer greater than the maximum value and
a negative integer less than or equal to the minimum value cannot be
represented as an integer literal, and are instead parsed as a `{float}`.
The minimum integer value can still be obtained through integer arithmetic."""
