positioning on the page: with a `top + left`
[`alignment`]($place.alignment), the offsets `dx` and `dy` will set the
position of the element's top left corner relatively to the top left corner

Overlaid elements don't take space in the flow of content, but a `place`
call inserts an invisible block-level element in the flow. This can
affect the layout by breaking the current paragraph. To avoid this,
you can wrap the `place` call in a [`box`] when the call is made
in the middle of a paragraph. The alignment and offsets will then be
relative to this zero-size box. To make sure it doesn't interfere with
spacing, the box should be attached to a word using a word joiner."""
